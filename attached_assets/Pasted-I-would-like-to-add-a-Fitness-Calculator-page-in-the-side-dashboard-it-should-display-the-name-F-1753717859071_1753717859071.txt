I would like to add a "Fitness Calculator" page in the side dashboard, it should display the name "Fitness Calculator" with a gray/white calculator icon (icon color and UI should match existing dashboard page icons) - when tapped it will navigate to a calculator dashboard-style page (using consistent UI design from the rest of the app) where there will be three large display section boxes - the first will be called "Calorie Tracker" this calculator will pull the users current: height, weight, goal weight (whether set to "gain" or "lose") from the Measurements page and a prompt to select an activity level from: sedentary, light, moderate, very, extra (this level can be edited at anytime from the section box with an edit button) and factor a range of calories to consume per day to either gain or lose weight to get to goal weight in increments of 0lbs, 0.5lbs, 1lbs, 1.5lbs and 2lbs per week. These increments will be shown in a grid style display with one column being “To Lose/Gain” showing the lbs per week down the column & the other column being “Consume” showing the associated calories to consume based on the factoring and related to each lbs column.

The next large section box as you scroll down in the page will be called "BMI Calculator" - this section will display users current BMI factoring together the users current weight and height from the measurements page and display a circle/ring display of the BMI (current BMI number displayed in center of ring) the BMI ranges will go from 0-18.5 (if in this range display "low" under the number in the ring) (ring color display as BLUE), 18.5-25 (display "average" under ring number & ring color is GREEN), 25-30 (display "slightly high" & ring color ORANGE), 30 or above (display "high" & ring color RED) 

The last large section box will be called “Macro Calculator” - it will pull the users current height, weight, use the activity level prompt and use a new prompt to have the use select either gain 0.5 - 2lbs per week, maintain weight, or lose 0.5-2 lbs per week. This will display a full MACRO NUTRIENT breakdown of carbs, protein and fat. It will have a tailored column where users can define the percentages of each macro, a High protein column, a standard column and a low carb column.
