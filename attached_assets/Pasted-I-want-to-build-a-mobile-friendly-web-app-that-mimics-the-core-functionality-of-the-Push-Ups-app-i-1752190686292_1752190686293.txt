I want to build a mobile-friendly web app that mimics the core functionality of the ‚ÄúPush-Ups‚Äù app in the iOS App Store (black background, large green circle for reps), but I want to significantly expand and improve its functionality. Please help me build the first working version.

‚∏ª

üéØ Core Functionality:
	1.	The app should have tappable circular buttons for 4 exercises:
	‚Ä¢	Pushups
	‚Ä¢	Bodyweight Squats
	‚Ä¢	Sit-ups
	‚Ä¢	Pull-ups (or Bar Hang seconds)
	2.	Tapping a button should increase today‚Äôs count by 1 for that exercise.
	3.	Each exercise should have its own labeled green circular counter (similar in design to the Push-Ups app) that increases as I tap.
	4.	Include an UNDO button below each circle to subtract 1 from the current day‚Äôs count if tapped too many times.
	5.	Show the current date at the top, and automatically track/log the reps for that date only.
	6.	Store the log of reps locally in the browser using localStorage. This should persist even if the page is refreshed.

Design Goals:
	‚Ä¢	Keep the UI simple and clean like the original Push-Ups app.
	‚Ä¢	Use a dark background with bright circular counters.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure it looks good on mobile (responsive layout).
	‚Ä¢	Circles should scale slightly or visually ‚Äúbounce‚Äù when tapped (optional, but nice UX).
	‚Ä¢	Show a confirmation animation or flash when a tap registers (optional).

‚∏ª

üß† Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript only (no frameworks unless needed for UI polish).
	‚Ä¢	Store logs in localStorage using keys like:
log = { 'Jul 10, 2025': { pushups: 160, squats: 100, situps: 0, pullups: 0 } }
	‚Ä¢	On app load, pull today‚Äôs entry from storage, or create a new one.
	‚Ä¢	On every tap or undo, immediately update both the UI and localStorage.

‚∏ª

üîÑ Future Features (optional, for later phases):
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to edit previous day‚Äôs counts if they forgot to log something.
	‚Ä¢	Add goal tracking (e.g., ‚Äú200 reps/day goal met!‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Allow changing exercises or number of visible trackers.
	‚Ä¢	Export log as CSV.
	‚Ä¢	Save to cloud with Firebase/Supabase (for future login/syncing).

üëã What I Want From You (Replit AI):

Start by helping me build the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this:
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-friendly layout
	‚Ä¢	4 tappable circular counters
	‚Ä¢	Undo buttons
	‚Ä¢	Date tracking
	‚Ä¢	localStorage for saving logs
	‚Ä¢	Scrollable daily log list

Please explain each step briefly as we go, and let me know how to customize it later (e.g., to add more exercises or change the style). Let‚Äôs build it together step by step.
